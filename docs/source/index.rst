What is the rAPId sdk
=====================

The rAPId sdk is a lightweight Python wrapper for the `rAPId sdk <https://github.com
that enable departments to discover, manage and share data and metadata amongst themselves./no10ds/rapid-api>`_. rAPId aims to create consistent, secure, interoperable data storage and sharing interfaces (APIs)

The sdk is a standalone Python library that can provide easy programmatic access to the core rAPId endpoints. It can handle programmatic schema creation and updation using modern Python classes and data structures.
